		<p class="body"><span class="drop lquot">&ldquo;</span>Patrick is superbly talented as a designer and brings a keen eye and curiosity to each project he takes on. We brought in Patrick for a one-year contract to manage primarily quick-turn projects and revisions to ongoing projects for our top clients Charles Schwab and HP. This is fast-paced and also exacting work that needs to meet the standards of these Fortune 500 clients. [He] has demonstrated an ability to be highly responsive to these demands while also having a knack for solving technical design software and file management issues. His contribution to AHA! has been tremendous.</p>

He always brought a welcome level of enthusiasm and determination to each facet of his work, day in and day out...He was always willing to work with us to ensure that our final product was exactly as we envisioned it, and he was never hesitant to spend the extra time necessary to make sure we were satisfied.</p>

He understood the direction that was given and delivered the creative quickly, for both print and online assets.</p>
